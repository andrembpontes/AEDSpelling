A cat runs on the road
A car runs over the cat
The road is now closed
Because the cat is dead

The car crushed the cat
He is now bloody and flat
Strangest accident Clear sky No fog
Although the driver was a dog

AT text_002 11
The dog was blamed
Arrested and chained
The cat was mourned
buried and boxed

The event was soon forgot
For the fish was never caught
As his decision was wise
To plan the cats demise
By blackmailing the dog
With photos of him and the hog
